# Slide 1: Title Slide

### üè† Story Format
"Welcome to Cloud City! Today we're learning how to build secure neighborhoods in Microsoft's cloud. Just like a city planner needs to understand zoning, roads, and security, we need to understand Azure Virtual Network."

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Discussion
"This is our blueprint for creating isolated, secure network environments in Azure. It's the foundation for all our cloud applications."

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation
"We'll be creating virtual networks, subnets, and security rules to host our applications securely."

### ‚úÖ Best Practice
"Always start with VNET design before deploying any resources - it's easier to build right than to fix later."

# Slide 2: What is VNET? (Layman Terms)

### üè† Story Format

"Imagine you're building a gated community. The wall around your community is like a VNET - it keeps your residents safe and separates them from the public streets. Inside, your houses can visit each other freely, but outsiders need permission to enter."

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Discussion

"VNET provides logical isolation - your resources are in your private network space, separate from other customers. It's like having your own private section of the cloud."

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

"When you create a VNET, you define an IP address range (like 10.0.0.0/16) that only your resources can use."

### ‚úÖ Best Practice

"Think of VNET as your first security layer - never deploy resources without one."

```mermaid
graph TD

    B --> C[Subnets: Web, App, DB]
    C --> D[VMs, Apps, Databases]
```

# Slide 3: Why Use VNET?

### üè† Story Format

"Why build a gated community instead of houses along a busy highway? Security - you control who enters. Organization - you can create different zones (quiet family area, commercial area). Connectivity - you can build private roads to your other properties."

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Discussion

"VNET gives us three key benefits: network isolation, traffic control, and hybrid connectivity. Without it, every resource is exposed to the public internet."

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

"We use VNET to group related resources, apply security rules, and connect to on-premises datacenters via VPN or ExpressRoute."

### ‚úÖ Best Practice

"Design your VNET before any deployment. Consider future growth and connectivity requirements."

# Slide 4: VNET Architecture Components

### üè† Story Format

"Building our community requires: Land (Address Space), plots (Subnets), security gates (NSGs), street signs (Route Tables), and utility connections (Service Endpoints)."

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Discussion

"These components work together to create a functional, secure network. Address space defines your total available 'land,' subnets divide it logically, NSGs control traffic flow."

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

```json
{
  "vnet": "10.0.0.0/16",
  "subnets": ["web", "app", "db"],
  "nsgs": ["allow-http", "block-internet"]
}
```

### ‚úÖ Best Practice

"Plan your IP address space carefully - it's hard to change later. Leave room for growth."

```mermaid

    E --> F[NSG + Route Tables]
```

---

## üß± 1. Address Space (A)

### Concept:

* The **Address Space** defines the entire **IP range** available within a **Virtual Network (VNET)**.
* In this case, it‚Äôs **`10.0.0.0/16`**, which allows roughly **65,536 IP addresses** (from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255).
* Think of this as the *total plot of land* you own ‚Äî all subnets (plots) must fit inside it.

### Azure Command Example:

```bash
az network vnet create \
  --name vnet-main \
  --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
  --resource-group rg-network
```

### Best Practices:

* Use **non-overlapping CIDR blocks** across environments (Dev, QA, Prod).
* Keep space for **future subnets** or integration (e.g., VPN, ExpressRoute).

---

## üèòÔ∏è 2. Subnets (B)

### Concept:

* **Subnets** are *divisions* of the main address space ‚Äî like splitting your land into smaller plots.
* Each subnet isolates resources logically and can apply unique security and routing rules.

### Example:

| Subnet Name | Address Prefix | Purpose                             |
| ----------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| web-subnet  | 10.0.1.0/24    | Web servers / Frontend              |
| app-subnet  | 10.0.2.0/24    | Application layer (APIs, Functions) |
| db-subnet   | 10.0.3.0/24    | Databases, caches, private storage  |

### Command Example:

```bash
az network vnet subnet create \
  --name web-subnet \
  --address-prefix 10.0.1.0/24 \
  --vnet-name vnet-main \
  --resource-group rg-network
```

### Best Practices:

* Use `/24` or larger blocks to prevent IP exhaustion.
* Don‚Äôt place public and private workloads in the same subnet.

---

## üåê 3. Web Subnet (C)

### Purpose:

* Hosts **frontend-facing services** like App Services, AKS Web Pods, or VMs behind a public load balancer.
* Typically exposed through **Azure Front Door** or **Application Gateway (WAF)**.

### Security:

* NSG allows inbound HTTP/HTTPS (80/443) only from trusted public IPs or the gateway.
* Outbound access may be restricted or routed through a firewall.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. App Subnet (D)

### Purpose:

* Houses **internal applications**, APIs, or microservices that talk to both the Web and DB layers.
* Usually accessed via **internal load balancers** ‚Äî never exposed directly to the internet.

### Security:

* NSG allows traffic **only from Web Subnet (10.0.1.0/24)** on application ports (e.g., 8080, 5000).
* Outbound traffic allowed only to **DB Subnet** or internal services.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è 5. DB Subnet (E)

### Purpose:

* Contains **data-layer resources** such as:

  * Azure SQL with **Private Endpoint**
  * Cosmos DB with **Private Link**
  * Redis or Storage Accounts (VNET integrated)

### Security:

* Inbound only from **App Subnet**.
* No internet access at all.
* NSG rules enforce ‚Äúdeny all inbound‚Äù except specific application ports (1433, 6379, etc.).
* Traffic often routed through **private DNS zones**.

---

## üîí 6. NSG + Route Tables (F)

### Network Security Group (NSG)

Acts like a **firewall** for subnets or NICs:

* Controls inbound/outbound traffic using rules.
* Evaluated by **priority** (lower number = higher priority).

**Example NSG Rules:**

| Priority | Name      | Direction | Source     | Destination | Port  | Action |
| -------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----- | ------ |
| 100      | Allow-Web | Inbound   | Internet   | Web Subnet  | 443   | Allow  |
| 200      | Allow-App | Inbound   | Web Subnet | App Subnet  | 8080  | Allow  |
| 300      | Allow-DB  | Inbound   | App Subnet | DB Subnet   | 1433  | Allow  |
| 4000     | Deny-All  | Inbound   | *Any*      | *Any*       | *Any* | Deny   |

**Command Example:**

```bash
az network nsg rule create \
  --nsg-name nsg-db \
  --name allow-app-to-db \
  --priority 300 \
  --direction Inbound \
  --source-address-prefixes 10.0.2.0/24 \
  --destination-address-prefixes 10.0.3.0/24 \
  --destination-port-ranges 1433 \
  --access Allow
```

---

### Route Table

Defines **custom routing** for traffic control:

* Useful for **forcing traffic through firewalls** or **ExpressRoute gateways**.
* Applied at the **subnet level**.

**Example:**

| Destination CIDR | Next Hop Type           | Next Hop IP           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| 0.0.0.0/0        | Virtual Appliance       | 10.0.100.4 (Firewall) |
| 192.168.0.0/16   | Virtual Network Gateway | ‚Äî                     |

**Command Example:**

```bash
az network route-table route create \
  --route-table-name rt-db \
  --name route-to-firewall \
  --address-prefix 0.0.0.0/0 \
  --next-hop-type VirtualAppliance \
  --next-hop-ip-address 10.0.100.4
```

---

## üß© End-to-End Flow Summary

| Step | Source      | Destination                   | Flow Description                       |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Internet    | Web Subnet                    | Through Front Door / App Gateway       |
| 2    | Web Subnet  | App Subnet                    | Via internal LB (port 8080/5000)       |
| 3    | App Subnet  | DB Subnet                     | SQL or Redis protocol (private)        |
| 4    | DB Subnet   | Firewall                      | Outbound internet restricted or routed |
| 5    | All Subnets | Azure Monitor / Log Analytics | Flow logs, NSG diagnostics             |

---

## üß† Visual Analogy

| Component         | Real-world Analogy                            |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Address Space     | The entire gated community land               |
| Subnets           | Individual zones (Residential, Office, Vault) |
| NSG               | Security guards and access gates              |
| Route Table       | Traffic signs and routing rules               |
| Private Endpoints | Private back doors for internal deliveries    |

Would you like me to add a **second diagram** showing the **traffic flow (Internet ‚Üí Web ‚Üí App ‚Üí DB ‚Üí Firewall)** layered with NSG and routing enforcement visually in Mermaid? It would make the packet path crystal clear.

# Slide 5: VNET Structure Example

### üè† Story Format

"In our community, we have different zones: the front area for shops (Web Subnet), middle for offices (App Subnet), secure back area for vaults (DB Subnet), and management offices (Mgmt Subnet)."

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Discussion

"This is a classic 3-tier architecture with management. Each tier has different security requirements and communicates in a specific flow."

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

```bash
az network vnet subnet create --name web --address-prefix 10.0.1.0/24
az network vnet subnet create --name app --address-prefix 10.0.2.0/24
az network vnet subnet create --name db --address-prefix 10.0.3.0/24
```

### ‚úÖ Best Practice

"Use at least /24 subnets (256 IPs) for production workloads. Create dedicated management subnets for admin tools."

```mermaid

# Slide 6: VNET Vertical Alignment

### üè† Story Format

"Imagine a secure office building: Lobby (Public Tier) ‚Üí Reception (Web Tier) ‚Üí Manager Offices (App Tier) ‚Üí Vault (Data Tier). Visitors can't jump from lobby to vault directly."

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Discussion

"This layered approach ensures security through segmentation. Each layer only talks to adjacent layers, preventing direct internet-to-database connections."

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

```
Internet ‚Üí [Azure Front Door] ‚Üí [Web Subnet] ‚Üí [App Subnet] ‚Üí [DB Subnet]
```

**üîó Azure Services Integration:**
"Use Azure Front Door or Application Gateway as your secure entry point with Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection."

**‚úÖ Best Practice:**
"Never allow direct internet access to application or database tiers. Use load balancers between tiers."

```mermaid
graph TD
    I[Internet] --> FD[Azure Front Door]
    FD --> AGW[Application Gateway]
    AGW --> WEB[Web Subnet]

# Slide 7: VNET Horizontal Alignment

### üè† Story Format

"In each building floor (tier), different departments need to work together: IT team (Compute), file room (Data), security team (Network), and management (Monitoring)."

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Discussion

"Horizontal integration ensures services within the same tier can communicate efficiently while maintaining security boundaries."

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

"Use VNET integration for App Services, Private Endpoints for databases, and service endpoints for platform services."

**‚úÖ Best Practice:** "Use Private Endpoints for all data services - they provide the highest security by eliminating public endpoints."

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Web Tier] -->|Internal LB| B[App Tier]
    B -->|Private Endpoints| C[Data Tier]

# Slide 8: VNET Integration Patterns

### üè† Story Format

"Different ways to connect to our community: Living inside (Direct), having a secret tunnel (VNET Integration), or getting a private mailbox (Private Endpoints)."

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Discussion

"Each pattern serves different use cases. Direct integration for IaaS, VNET integration for PaaS, Private Endpoints for maximum security."

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

* **Direct:** VMs, AKS in subnets
* **VNET Integration:** App Service, Functions
* **Private Endpoints:** SQL, Storage, Key Vault

**‚úÖ Best Practice:**
"Migrate from Service Endpoints to Private Endpoints for better security. Private Endpoints provide true private IP addresses."

```mermaid

# Slide 9: VNET Types

### üè† Story Format

"Different community designs: Single house (one VNET), Town square with streets (Hub-Spoke), Sister cities (Peered VNETs), or Apartment building (Multi-tenant)."

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Discussion

"Hub-Spoke is the enterprise standard. Hub contains shared services (firewall, VPN), spokes contain workloads. This provides isolation and cost efficiency."

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

```bash
az network vnet peering create --name hub-to-spoke1 \
  --remote-vnet spoke1-vnet --vnet-name hub-vnet
```

**‚úÖ Best Practice:**
"Use Hub-Spoke for environments with multiple teams or applications. Centralize security services in the hub."

```mermaid
graph TD
    HUB[Hub VNET] --> SPOKE1[Spoke 1]
    HUB --> SPOKE2[Spoke 2]
    HUB --> SPOKE3[Spoke 3]

# Slide 10: NSG Integration

### üè† Story Format

"Security guards with specific instructions: 'Allow delivery trucks to shops, allow employees between offices, but block everyone from the vault area.'"

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Discussion

"NSGs provide distributed firewall capability. Apply at subnet level for broad policies, at NIC level for granular control."

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

```json
{
  "NSG Rules": [
    "Allow HTTP (80) from Internet to Web Subnet",
    "Allow HTTP (8080) from Web to App Subnet",
    "Allow SQL (1433) from App to DB Subnet",
    "Deny All from Internet to DB Subnet"
  ]
}
```

**‚úÖ Best Practice:**
"Apply NSGs at subnet level for consistency. Use service tags and ASGs for manageability."

```mermaid
graph TD
    I[Internet] -->|80| W[Web Subnet]
    W -->|8080| A[App Subnet]

# Slide 11: On-Premises Connectivity

### üè† Story Format

"Building roads to your main office: A toll highway (VPN) or a private direct railway (ExpressRoute). Plus a secure guard house (Bastion) for remote management."

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Discussion

"VPN uses encrypted internet tunnels, ExpressRoute provides private dedicated circuits. Bastion provides secure jumpbox functionality without public IPs."

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

* **VPN Gateway:** Site-to-Site VPN
* **ExpressRoute:** Dedicated circuit
* **Bastion:** Browser-based secure RDP

**‚úÖ Best Practice:**
"Use ExpressRoute for production workloads requiring SLA. Always use Bastion for VM management instead of public IPs."

```mermaid

# Slide 12: Hybrid Architecture

### üè† Story Format

"Your main office connected to a central distribution center (Hub), which then connects to multiple warehouses (Spokes) for different products."

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Discussion

"This pattern centralizes security and connectivity while isolating workloads. All traffic between on-premises and cloud flows through the hub."

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

```
On-Prem ‚Üí VPN/ExpressRoute ‚Üí [Hub VNET] ‚Üí Peering ‚Üí [Spoke VNETs]
```

**‚úÖ Best Practice:**

# Slide 14: Public vs Private Resources

### üè† Story Format

"Storefront vs Back Office: The store is public-facing but secure, while the accounting office is completely private."

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Discussion

"Public resources have public IPs and are designed for external access. Private resources only have internal IPs and are accessed through routing."

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

* **Public:** Front Door, Application Gateway
* **Private:** Internal LB, Private Endpoints

**‚úÖ Best Practice:**
"Minimize public endpoints. Use one secured entry point."
